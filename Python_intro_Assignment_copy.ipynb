    "\n",

    "$ less train_to_busan_description.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's it explore it more quantitatively using Python.  Data exploration\n",
    "is a perfect use-case for Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "As described in the [Jupyter Notebook Quickstart Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html):\n",
    "> Jupyter Notebook documents (or “notebooks”, all lower case) are documents produced by \n",
    "> the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. Python) and \n",
    "> rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc…). Notebook \n",
    "> documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description \n",
    "> and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which \n",
    "> can be run to perform data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks run the IPython interactive kernel in \"Code\" cells, but then allow for \n",
    "text formatting and use of sophisticated Latex rendering using MathJax (see these [examples](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Typesetting%20Equations.html)) in \"Markdown\" cells.  This makes them a good candidate for\n",
    "Python lectures to technical audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One distinguishing characteristic of Jupyter Notebooks is that code is executed in cells.\n",
    "Therefore you can execute a bit of code, and then in the next or (_horror_) preceding cell\n",
    "query the results of code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are also visually-pleasing graphical environments.  Plots show up naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their non-linear, iterative, cellular, and visual nature make Jupyter Notebooks a powerful\n",
    "tool for rapid data exploration and visualization.  However, these same characteristics (as\n",
    "well as poor git tracking/merging) sabotage their use as a way to create a sequential operating\n",
    "script executable from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often a project will start with exploration in a Jupyter Notebook but end with an\n",
    "application deployed as a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate the use of a Jupyter Notebook to explore the `train_to_busan_description.txt`\n",
    "file.  In Terminal, navigate to the `notebooks` folder of this repository.  Once inside,\n",
    "open the Jupyter notebook inside and execute cell-by-cell sequentially using `shift-enter`,\n",
    "carefully reading the comments and observing the syntax along the way.  Don't be afraid to add\n",
    "cells and perform your own exploration and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you open a Jupyter Notebook from the command line:  \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ jupyter notebook explore_movie_description.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You know a file is Jupyter Notebook from its `*.ipynb` file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 - Fill in the `text_parsing_functions.py` functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've explored the text and gained some familiarity with functions (in the\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook) that could be used to clean it, let's transition to writing scripts for\n",
    "the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work environment requires a text editor and two Terminals.  They all should be set \n",
    "to run from the project's root directory.  You can get set-up by navigating to the \n",
    "repository from Terminal, then using VSCode to open the project, then opening up\n",
    "another Terminal in the same location and executing IPython.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/galvanize/repos/python-intro\n",
    "$ code .\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note the space then period (.) after code above.  The period signifies the current\n",
    "directory (we're inside `python-intro` so open up VSCode inside this repository).\n",
    "\n",
    "Switch back to Terminal using `Alt + Tab` (Linux) or `Command + Tab` (Mac) then use\n",
    "a shortcut to open another Terminal in the same location: `Ctrl + Shift + t` (Linux) or\n",
    "`Command + t` (Mac).  In that Terminal, start IPython:  \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ipython\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you don't have any other applications besides a web browser running (and why would you?!?), you can now easily switch between your text editor and Terminals using `Alt` or `Command + Tab`.\n",
    "Note that [VSCode also has an integrated Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal). You may want to start IPython there instead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `description_parser.py` file will need text parsing functions to condense\n",
    "the movie descriptions.  These functions _could_ be written in the `description_parser.py` \n",
    "file itself, but these text parsing functions could be useful in other applications too.\n",
    "So let's develop and test the text parsing functions in a separate script - `text_parsing_functions.py` -\n",
    "and then once they are working as desired _import_ them into the `description_parser.py` file \n",
    "for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "`text_parsing_functions.py` has been started for you.  It's in the `src` folder.\n",
    "1. Fill in the functions in `text_parsing_functions.py`, starting from the top.  Make sure you return values from the functions, and delete `pass` as you do. Test them as you go by calling the functions\n",
    "given the provided test strings under the `# your code below` comment under the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.  As an example, the first function has been completed and tested for you.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you run this script from within the IPython interactive console, so that you can query values in IPython after executing the script: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: run src/text_parsing_functions.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Part 3 - Try out the Python Standard Library Debugger (PDB)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you'd like to be able to check values in functions or classes as your code executes.  Python provides a simple way to do that using the Python debugger (pdb).  As shown below, insert a `breakpoint()` into your `line_cleaning_pipeline` and execute your code.  You will be dropped into the debugger at\n",
    "the `breakpoint()` where you can query values after a given line has been run.  `n` executes the current line of code.  Try it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def line_cleaning_pipeline(text, stopwords_set, name_set, replace_val):\n",

    "    text_nnl = remove_newline(text_np)\n",
    "    words = split_text_into_words(text_nnl)\n",
    "    words_nsw = remove_stopwords(words, stopwords_set)\n",
    "    words_cleaned = replace_names(words_nsw, name_set, replace_val) \n",
    "    line_of_text_cleaned = create_cleaned_textline_from_words(words_cleaned)\n",
    "    return line_of_text_cleaned\n",
    "```\n",
    "After entering the debugger, to see if `text_lc` evaluated correctly type `n` which evaulates the line and then type `text_lc` to see what its value is.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An especially valuable use of the debugger is to insert a `breakpoint()` on a line immediately\n",
    "before you have code that gives you some kind of execution error.  You'll be able to query\n",
    "variables (like you did with `text_lc` above) to see if they contain the values you think they do!\n",
    "\n",
    "`q` quits the debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delete the `breakpoint()` when you no longer need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your course `quick-reference` folder contains a `PDB.pdf` cheatsheet listing common Python debugger commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4 - Create and fill out the `description_parser.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have line-cleaning functions in `text_parsing_functions.py` let's import\n",
    "those functions into another file so that file can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make a `description_parser.py` file in the `src` directory, and add the following lines\n",
    "to it.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS\n",

    "    print(cleaned_text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note now that this script import functions from the `text_parsing_functions.py` script and\n",
    "that they are accessed using the prefix `tpf.` which we assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute this code.  You may do it from the IPython console, or you may execute it directly\n",
    "from Terminal:\n",

    "line-cleaning-pipeline. Using the **With Statement** construction in this [blog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/read-a-file-line-by-line-in-python/), add a function to `description_parser.py` that takes\n",

    "```python\n",

    "4. Now refactor your function that reads and print all the lines in a file to take\n",
